:rotating_light: CloudKernel is about extreme simplification for RELIABILITY. :rotating_light:

The intent of our effort to *introduce* the idea of RELIABILITY ENGINEERING to the realm of computing about things like developing the the most extremely lightweight, very most minimal baselayers which would comprise a monitorable, reliably secure :closed_lock_with_key: realtime operating system for **highly reliable** :stethoscope: observeable edgeOS or use cases such as :alembic: HPC computing :test_tube: for which an important :thread: or set of threads completely dominate the :alembic: computing purposes :test_tube: of any use case for a container image.

***Contribution guidelines?*** 

Thank you for your interest -- check back in a week or so ... *For now, just familiarize yourself with [OSTree](https://ostreedev.github.io/ostree/) and the general topics of [immutable operating systems](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-coreos/) and proto-OS layers for [layered image build systems](https://docs.pagure.org/releng/layered_image_build_service.html) which yield immutable, ultra-secure, more reliable, [monitorable operating systems](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=%22monitorability%22+%22operating+system%22&searchtype=all&abstracts=show&order=-announced_date_first&size=200) for container images.*
