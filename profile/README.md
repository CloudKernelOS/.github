:rotating_light: CloudKernel is a push for extreme simplification for improving RELIABILITY. :rotating_light:

The general intention is about developing the the most extremely lightweight, very most minimal baselayers which would comprise a [monitorable]((https://arxiv.org/search/?query=%22monitorability%22+%22operating+system%22&searchtype=all&abstracts=show&order=-announced_date_first&size=200)), secure :closed_lock_with_key: RTOS for ensuring [observeability](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/observability-engineering/9781492076438/) :stethoscope: in safety-critical edgeOS or use cases such as :alembic: high performance computing or scientific computing :test_tube: for which an important set of threads :thread: completely dominate the :alembic: computing purposes :test_tube: of any use case for a container image.

***Contribution guidelines?*** 

*Thank you for your interest -- check back in a week or so -- for now just* ... familiarize yourself with [OSTree](https://ostreedev.github.io/ostree/) and the general topics of [immutable operating systems](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-coreos/) and proto-OS layers for [layered image build systems](https://docs.pagure.org/releng/layered_image_build_service.html) which yield immutable, ultra-secure, more reliable, [monitorable operating systems](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=%22monitorability%22+%22operating+system%22&searchtype=all&abstracts=show&order=-announced_date_first&size=200) for container images.
