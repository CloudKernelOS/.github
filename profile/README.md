üë©‚Äçüíª CloudKernel is about extreme simplification for RELIABILITY. The intent of this effort is to develop the the most extremely lightweight, very most minimal baselayers which would comprise a monitorable, reliably secure :closed_lock_with_key: realtime operating system for **highly reliable** :stethoscope: observeable edgeOS or use cases such as :alembic: HPC computing :test_tube: for which an important :thread: or set of threads completely dominate the :alembic: computing purposes :test_tube: of any use case for a container image.
